# 🎨 HYPERSPEED BACKGROUND - WHERE TO USE?

## ✅ **BEST PLACES TO USE:**

### 1. **Loading States** (RECOMMENDED - Light usage)
- Search loading screen
- Product tracking in progress
- Data fetching animations
- **Why:** Short duration, adds excitement during wait times

### 2. **Success/Achievement Pages** (BEST FIT!)
- After successfully tracking a product
- Account created successfully page
- Price alert triggered page
- **Why:** Celebrates user action, temporary display

### 3. **Hero Section Background** (USE WITH CAUTION)
- Homepage hero section (behind main content)
- Use with reduced opacity (20-30%)
- Add toggle to disable for performance
- **Why:** Eye-catching but can be heavy on continuous display

### 4. **Modal Backgrounds** (GOOD CHOICE)
- Behind login/signup modal
- Behind success confirmation modals
- **Why:** Temporary, focused attention

---

## ❌ **AVOID USING:**
- Entire page backgrounds (too heavy)
- Continuous display areas
- Product listing pages (distracting)
- Mobile devices (performance issues)

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Use Hyperspeed for SUCCESS CELEBRATION:**
```
User tracks product → 
Show Hyperspeed background for 2-3 seconds → 
Display "Product Tracked!" message →
Fade out to normal page
```

This gives:
- ✨ Exciting feedback
- 🎉 Dopamine hit
- ⚡ Short duration (no performance impact)
- 🚀 Memorable experience

**Want me to implement it as a success animation?**
